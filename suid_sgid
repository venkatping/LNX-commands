1. SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) are file permissions in Linux that allow a user to execute a file with the privileges of the file owner or group respectively, rather than with their own permissions.

2. When a file is given the SUID permission, it runs with the permissions of the owner of the file rather than the user who executed the file.

3. Similarly, when a file is given the SGID permission, it runs with the permissions of the group that owns the file rather than the user who executed the file.

The numeric representation of the suid bit is 4
The SGID bit is represented by the number 2
