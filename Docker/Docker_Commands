9. when we want to RUN an ubuntu/centos container, when we execute # docker run untuntu, it will run and will immediately exists why?
unlike virtual machines, containers are meant to host an Operating system(ubuntu/centos)
Containers are meant to RUN a specific task or process such as webserver, App server, DB server etc, once the taask completes and it will exit
container only lives as long as the process inside it is alive, if the webserver inside the container stopped/crashed then the container will exit
This is why when we RUN a container with ubuntu/centos image, it will stop immediately, because ubuntu is just an image of an OS and there is no process/Application running in it

# docker run ubuntu sleep 100

# docker exec <container_name> cat /etc/hosts
