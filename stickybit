1. Sticky bit is a permission bit that can be set on a directory in Linux/Unix systems. When the sticky bit is set on a directory, it allows only the owner of the file to delete or rename the files within that directory, even if the other users have write permission on that directory.
2. This feature is commonly used on shared directories to prevent accidental deletion of files by other users.
The sticky bit is represented by the letter "t" in the output of the ls command, following the other file permission flags (e.g., drwxr-xr-t for a directory with the sticky bit set).

4. The sticky bit on a directory ensures that only the owner of a file can delete or rename the file, even if other users have write permissions on the directory.
