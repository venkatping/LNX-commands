2. Login to the server with root access and install the migration tool:
zypper install yast2-migration

3. Update the package management tools with the old SUSE Linux Enterprise repositories.
zypper patch --updatestack-only

4. Get a list of packages that currently do not have a repository assigned to them (orphaned packages):
zypper packages --orphaned
Carefully review the list and remove all orphaned packages that are no longer needed. Make a note of all remaining orphaned packages, you will need it later for comparison.

5. Get a list of all repositories that the system is currently subscribed:
zypper repos -u

6. Update each repository URL so that its product version number is 15-SP3. For example, if the URL of a repository is
http://rmt.example.com/repo/SUSE/Products/SLE-15-SP2-Product-SLES/x86_64/product/

change it to
http://rmt.example.com/repo/SUSE/Products/SLE-15-SP3-Product-SLES/x86_64/product/

7. Review your changes by running zypper repos -u and update the repositories by running:
sudo zypper refresh -f -s

In case updating a repository fails, double-check whether you entered the wrong URL. If the problem cannot be fixed, it is recommended to disable the failing repository.
If all repositories are correctly configured, run
sudo zypper refresh -f -s

again, to make sure all repositories are up-to-date.

8. Before starting the migration it is recommended do a test run first:
sudo zypper dup -D --no-allow-vendor-change --no-recommends

9. If problems occur, fix them before proceeding. In case the test run succeeds, perform the real migration by running:
sudo zypper dup --no-allow-vendor-change --no-recommends

-no-allow-vendor-change ensures that third-party RPMs will not overwrite RPMs from the base system. The option --no-recommends ensures that packages deselected during initial installation will not be added again.
