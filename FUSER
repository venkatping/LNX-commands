# Locate Processes in a Directory
fuser .

# locate process running on home directory
fuser /home

# To Print more readable output. -v for verbose
fuser -v .

#Find processes accessing a file
fuser -v /home/username/filename

Under the ACCESS column, you will see access types signified by the following letters:

c – current directory
e – an executable file being run
f – open file, however, f is left out in the output
F – open file for writing, F is as well excluded from the output
r – root directory
m – mmap’ed file or shared library

#Identify the process running on TCP port 22
fuser -v -n tcp 22
fuser -v 22/tcp

# To list all files and processes running in the filesystem.
fuser -v -m /var/log/messages
-m flag with fuser to identify all processes accessing a filesystem by targeting a file belonging to that system
The option, -m NAME or --mount NAME means name all processes accessing the file NAME.
In case you a spell out directory as NAME, it is spontaneously changed to NAME/, to use any file system that is possibly mounted on that directory.

# -k flag terminates processes
fuser -v -k /home/filename

# Kill Processes Interactively
fuser -ki .

# list the signals fuser known
fuser -l
fuser --list-signals 

# To kill the process using TCP port 631 using the TERM signal
fuser -ki -TERM -n tcp 631

Another option is to use -5 as -[SIGNAL] and 631/TCP as the port name
fuser -ki -5 -n tcp 22/tcp
