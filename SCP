1. Copy a File from Local to Remote Server
# scp sample_example.txt root@136.183.142.28:/home/remote_dir

2. Copy a File from a Remote Server to the Local Host
# scp 147.182.143.27:/home/remote_dir/sample_example.txt /home/localhost/

3. Copy a File from One Remote Server to Another Remote server
# scp root@147.182.143.27:/home/remote_dir/sample_example.txt sofija@146.153.129.25:/home/ansible

4. Copy Multiple Files with SCP
# scp sample1.txt sample2.txt root@147.182.143.27:/home/remote_dir

5. Copy a Folder from Local Host to Remote Server Recursively
# scp -r example root@147.182.143.27:/home/remote_dir

6. Copy a File with SCP Using a Specific Port
# scp -P 2222  sample_example.txt root@147.182.143.27:/home/remote_dir

7. Copy a File with SCP in Quiet Mode(Running a scp command in quiet mode means disabling the progress meter and non-error messages from showing in the output)
# scp -q sample_example.txt root@136.183.142:/home/remote_dir

8. Copy a File with SCP in Verbose Mode
# scp -v sample_example.txt root@147.182.143.27:/home/remote_dir

9. Copy a File with SCP and Limit Bandwidth
Another helpful option is limiting the bandwidth used by the scp command by adding the -l parameter. This is especially useful when copying large files to prevent SCP from draining the bandwidth.
When limiting bandwidth, you need to specify the number in Kilobits/s. Bear in mind that 1 byte = 8 bits. Therefore, if you want to limit the bandwidth for SCP to 100 KB/s, the value for l in kbps would be 800 (100 x 8), as in the command below:
# scp -l 800 sample_example.txt root@147.182.143.27:/home/remote_dir

10. Copy a File with SCP Faster
To speed up the file transfer from one server to another, add the -C option that compresses the file while itâ€™s being transferred. Once the file reaches its destination, it returns to its normal size.
# scp -C sample_example.txt root@147.182.143.27:/home/remote_dir

11. Copy a File with SCP Using a Specific Cipher
# scp -c 3des sample_example.txt root@147.182.143.27:/home/remote_dir

12. Copy a File with SCP Using IPv4 or IPv6 -4 -6
# scp -6 sample_example.txt root@147.182.143.27:/home/remote_dir

13. Copy a File with SCP Preserving File Attributes
To copy a file using SCP and preserve file attributes such as modification and access times, modes, and permissions, use the -p option
# scp -p sample_example.txt root@147.182.143.27:/home/remote_dir
