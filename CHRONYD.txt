chronyc sources: This command displays a list of the NTP servers that your system is currently synchronizing with.

chronyc tracking: This command displays information about the current clock offset, jitter, and frequency error.

chronyc makestep: This command forces the system clock to be stepped immediately to match the NTP server, rather than adjusting the clock gradually over time.

chronyc settime: This command sets the system clock to a specific time. You can specify the time in several different formats, such as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.

chronyc -a "offline <server>": This command marks an NTP server as offline, which prevents the system from synchronizing with it. Replace <server> with the hostname or IP address of the server.

chronyc -a "online <server>": This command marks an NTP server as online, which allows the system to synchronize with it. Replace <server> with the hostname or IP address of the server.
