1. Create bootable USB drives: dd can be used to create bootable USB drives from ISO images. For example, to create a bootable USB drive from an ISO image named ubuntu.iso, run the following command:

# sudo dd if=ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress && sync

Replace /dev/sdX with the device path of your USB drive. This command will copy the ISO image to the USB drive and make it bootable.

2. Create disk images: dd can be used to create disk images of a particular device or partition. For example, to create a disk image of a partition named sda1, run the following command:


# sudo dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/path/to/image.img bs=4M status=progress

Replace /path/to/image.img with the path where you want to save the image.

3. Clone disks: dd can be used to clone one disk to another. For example, to clone a disk sda to sdb, run the following command:


# sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=4M status=progress

This command will copy the entire contents of sda to sdb.

4. Securely erase disks: dd can be used to securely erase the contents of a disk. For example, to securely erase a disk sda, run the following command:

# sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda bs=4M status=progress

This command will write random data to sda, making it difficult to recover any previous data.

5. Copy files with a specific block size: dd can be used to copy files with a specific block size. For example, to copy a file named file.txt with a block size of 1KB, run the following command:

# sudo dd if=file.txt of=/path/to/destination bs=1K status=progress

Replace /path/to/destination with the path where you want to save the file.

6. create 2G file

dd if=/dev/zero of=outputfile bs=1G count=2 status=progress

if=/dev/zero: Use /dev/zero as the input file. This means that dd will read from an endless stream of zeros.
of=outputfile: Use outputfile as the output file. This is the file that will be created and filled with zeros.
bs=1G: Set the block size to 1GB. This means that dd will write 1GB of zeros to the output file at a time.
count=2: Set the number of blocks to copy to 2. Since the block size is 1GB, this means that dd will copy 2GB of zeros to the output file.
