-n       inhibits the conversion of network numbers to host names for network files.  Inhibiting conversion may
                make lsof run faster.  It is also useful when host name lookup is not working properly.

-P       inhibits  the  conversion  of port numbers to port names for network files.  Inhibiting the conversion
                may make lsof run a little faster.  It is also useful when port name lookup is not working properly.
-i [i]   selects  the listing of files any of whose Internet address matches the address specified in i.  If no
                address is specified, this option selects the listing of all Internet and x.25 (HP-UX) network files.

-i select IPv[46] files
-P no port names
-n no host names
